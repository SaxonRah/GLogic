# Addressing Computational Complexity in GLogic

## 1. Problem Statement
GLogic embeds logical operations into Geometric Algebra (GA), offering a unique framework for inference. However, as noted in *Problems.md*, the computational complexity of GA operations—especially the wedge product and higher-order logic representations—may scale poorly. Without optimizations, GLogic might be impractical for large-scale applications. This document proposes a structured research and implementation strategy to mitigate these concerns.

## 2. Computational Complexity Analysis
### 2.1 Key Operations and Their Complexity
| Operation | Mathematical Definition | Expected Complexity |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Dot Product (A \cdot B) | Measures logical similarity | O(n) |
| Wedge Product (A \wedge B) | Encodes logical independence | O(n^2) to O(n^3) in high dimensions |
| Negation (-A) | Sign inversion in GA | O(1) |
| Logical Gates (AND, OR, XOR) | Defined via multivector operations | O(n^2) |
| Contradiction Detection (A \wedge -A) | Requires negation and wedge | O(n^2) |
| Quantifier Handling (\forall, \exists) | Encodes transformations over logical space | Potentially exponential in nested cases |

### 2.2 Bottleneck Identification
- **Wedge product growth**: In higher dimensions, wedge products generate exponentially growing terms.
- **Nested quantifiers**: Handling \forall x \exists y P(x,y) geometrically may introduce excessive computational costs.
- **Graph-based visualization**: Large logical graphs become intractable as relations expand.

## 3. Optimization Strategies
### 3.1 Algebraic Simplifications
- **Sparse Multivector Representations**: Instead of fully expanding every term, store only **nonzero coefficients** to reduce storage and computation.
- **Dimension Reduction via Subspaces**: Many logical relationships reside in lower-dimensional subspaces. Projecting statements into minimal basis spaces can reduce computational load.

### 3.2 Computational Techniques
- **Symbolic Pruning**: Before performing a computation, eliminate logically redundant terms using algebraic simplifications.
- **Efficient Matrix Representations**: Store multivectors in **block-diagonal form**, reducing memory overhead for transformations.
- **Precomputed Lookup Tables**: Frequently used operations (e.g., logical gates, common relations) can be cached.

### 3.3 Parallelization and Hardware Acceleration
- **Multithreading**: Parallelize independent geometric operations using CPU multi-threading.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Implement GA operations using CUDA to leverage parallel tensor computations.
- **Vectorized Computation**: Utilize optimized numerical libraries (e.g., NumPy, JAX) for GA tensor operations.

## 4. Benchmarking Against Traditional Logic Systems
### 4.1 Experiment Setup
- Compare **GLogic inference speed** against Boolean logic-based theorem provers.
- Evaluate **quantifier handling performance** against first-order logic solvers.
- Measure **contradiction detection efficiency** in real-world logical datasets.

### 4.2 Expected Metrics
| Metric | GLogic (Optimized) | Traditional Logic |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Inference Speed | O(n log n) | O(2^n) (truth tables) |
| Contradiction Detection | O(n^2) | O(2^n) (classical methods) |
| Quantifier Expansion | O(n^3) (optimized) | O(n^4) (first-order logic) |
