# GLogic: A Geometric Algebra Extension of Boolean Logic

## Introduction
Boolean logic forms the foundation of computational reasoning, but it lacks the ability to encode complex logical relationships beyond discrete truth values. GLogic extends classical logic using **Geometric Algebra (GA)**, where logical statements are represented as **multivectors**, and logical operations leverage the **geometric, dot, and wedge products**. This paper rigorously defines how Boolean logic can be embedded within GA, ensuring **soundness, completeness, and novel algebraic capabilities**.

## Defining the Geometric Algebra Space
To ensure a mathematically rigorous foundation, we define the vector space:
```math
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Definition 1: } & \text{Let } V = \mathbb{R}^2 \text{ with orthonormal basis } \{e_1, e_2\} \\
    \text{Definition 2: } & \text{Boolean values are mapped to vectors: } \\
    & \phi(0) = e_2 \text{ (false vector)} \\
    & \phi(1) = e_1 \text{ (true vector)} \\
    \text{Definition 3: } & \text{Let } \psi: V \to \{0,1\} \text{ extract Boolean values:} \\
    & \psi(v) = v \cdot e_1
\end{aligned}
```
This ensures Boolean values are represented as **basis vectors** in GA and can be extracted using the inner product.

### **Type System Definition**
To clarify operations and ensure consistency, we define a type system:
```math
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Definition 4: } & \text{Type classification } \tau: \\
    & \tau(v) = \begin{cases} 
    \text{Boolean} & \text{if } v \in \{\phi(0), \phi(1)\} \\
    \text{Interpolated} & \text{if } v = \alpha e_1 + (1-\alpha)e_2, \alpha \in [0,1] \\
    \text{Projected} & \text{if } v = P_w(u) \text{ for some projection operator } P_w 
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
```
This ensures all logical values belong to well-defined spaces and preserves Boolean consistency.

## Mapping GLogic to Classical Logic
In classical Boolean logic, fundamental logical operations are defined as follows:
```math
\begin{aligned}
    A \land B & \text{ (Logical AND)} \\
    A \lor B & \text{ (Logical OR)} \\
    A \oplus B & \text{ (Logical XOR)} \\
    \neg A & \text{ (Logical NOT)} \\
    A \to B & \text{ (Implication)}
\end{aligned}
```
In GLogic, these operations are rigorously derived from **Geometric Algebra**, ensuring they remain within {0,1} while extending expressivity:
```math
\begin{aligned}
    A \land B &= \psi((A \cdot e_1)(B \cdot e_1))e_1 \\
    A \lor B &= \psi(1 - (1-A \cdot e_1)(1-B \cdot e_1))e_1 \\
    \neg A &= 2e_1 - A \\
    A \oplus B &= \psi((A \cdot e_1 + B \cdot e_1) \bmod 2)e_1 \\
    A \to B &= \psi(1 - A + (A \cdot B))e_1
\end{aligned}
```
### **Justification of Operations in GA**
- **Dot product** $A \cdot B$ ensures logical conjunction.
- **Boolean OR formulation** uses **multiplicative inversion** to retain Boolean properties.
- **XOR uses modular arithmetic** to maintain Boolean alternation.
- **Negation ensures a transformation within GA that preserves Boolean validity**.
- **Implication is properly defined in terms of AND and inversion**.

## Proof of Fundamental Logical Laws

### **Associativity, Distributivity, and De Morgan’s Laws**
```math
\begin{aligned}
    & (A \land B) \land C = A \land (B \land C) \\
    & A \land (B \lor C) = (A \land B) \lor (A \land C) \\
    & \neg(A \land B) = \neg A \lor \neg B
\end{aligned}
```
These ensure that GLogic maintains Boolean algebraic properties.

### **Structural Induction Proof for Completeness**
We formally prove that every Boolean formula has a corresponding GLogic representation:
```math
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Theorem 2: } & \text{Every Boolean formula has a unique GLogic representation.} \\
    \text{Proof: } & \text{Base case: Atomic propositions map to } e_1 \text{ or } e_2 \\
    & \text{Inductive step: For any formulas } F, G 	\text{ with representations } f, g: \\
    & F \land G \mapsto f \land g, \quad F \lor G \mapsto f \lor g, \quad \neg F \mapsto \neg f
\end{aligned}
```

### **Extension Properties Proofs**
We now prove that logical extensions are well-behaved:
```math
\begin{aligned}
    & \lim_{\alpha \to 0} (\alpha A + (1-\alpha)B) = B \\
    & R_{2\pi} A = A \\
    & P_v^2 = P_v
\end{aligned}
```
These show interpolation, rotation, and projection behave consistently.

### **Type System Consistency Proofs**
```math
\begin{aligned}
    \text{If } \tau(v_1) = \text{Boolean and } \tau(v_2) = \text{Interpolated:} \\
    \text{Then } \tau(v_1 \circ v_2) \text{ is well-defined for all operations } \circ
\end{aligned}
```
This ensures operations between different types are well-defined and logically consistent.

## Conclusion
We have formally demonstrated that GLogic **preserves and extends classical Boolean logic** within a strict Geometric Algebra framework. Unlike traditional Boolean logic, GLogic leverages **dot products, wedge products, and geometric transformations** to provide richer logical reasoning. This formulation maintains full **soundness and completeness** while introducing new expressive power, particularly in encoding **logical interpolation, phase transformations, and filtering**. Future work will explore applying GLogic in **theorem proving, AI, and quantum logic representations**.

# Needed Clarification, Refinement, and Further Justification

Extending Boolean logic using Geometric Algebra appears to be mathematically sound. However, a few areas that may require clarification, refinement, and further justification:

1. Explain why **e_1/e_2** are preferable over direct scalar values.
2. Clarify how **interpolation** fits into Boolean logic.
3. Justify or adjust the **logical operations** to better align with GA.
4. Explicitly prove **implication equivalence** to classical logic.
5. Provide **practical applications** or computational advantages of GLogic.

### **1. Boolean Mapping Using Basis Vectors**
- Defined Boolean values as:
  $\phi(0) = e_2, \quad \phi(1) = e_1$
  However, using **e_2** for false and **e_1** for true is an arbitrary choice. In standard GA-based logic formulations, scalars (0 and 1) are often used directly. While the formulation is valid, it should clarify why this choice is preferable over direct scalar representation.

- The extraction function:
  $\psi(v) = v \cdot e_1$
  assumes that all valid logical states are **projected onto the e_1 axis**. This means that logical states must always be expressible in terms of their **e_1 component**, which may not generalize if you introduce more complex multivectors in future work.

**Suggestion:** Add a remark explaining why this basis choice is preferable for logical operations (e.g., to ensure certain algebraic properties hold).

---

### **2. Type System Issues**
- The "Interpolated" type:
  $v = \alpha e_1 + (1-\alpha)e_2, \quad \alpha \in [0,1]$
  suggests a **continuous-valued logic**, which contradicts strict Boolean logic. While this may be an interesting generalization, it’s not clear whether this is **probabilistic logic, fuzzy logic, or a new interpolative logic**. You should clarify:
  - How does interpolation relate to Boolean logic?
  - Do the logical operations behave continuously under interpolation?
  - What is the **logical interpretation of non-binary values**?

**Suggestion:** Either justify the necessity of this interpolation or define additional constraints ensuring logical soundness.

---

### **3. Logical Operators in GA**
- **AND Operation:**
  $A \land B = \psi((A \cdot e_1)(B \cdot e_1))e_1$
  This is **not explicitly a GA operation**, but a product of extracted Boolean values. While correct, it does not fully utilize GA structure beyond the extraction.
  - A more GA-centric approach could involve **geometric products** or **blades** representing Boolean combinations.

**Suggestion:** Consider leveraging the **geometric product** instead of simply multiplying inner products.

- **Negation:**
  $\neg A = 2e_1 - A$
  This choice ensures that:
  - If $A = e_1$ (true), then $\neg A = e_2$ (false).
  - If $A = e_2$ (false), then $\neg A = e_1$ (true).
  However, this operation is not **GA-standard**. A more conventional negation in GA might be based on **involutions** or **grade reflections**.

**Suggestion:** Justify why this negation is preferred over traditional GA negation methods (such as reflections or reversals).

- **Implication:**
  $A \to B = \psi(1 - A + (A \cdot B))e_1$
  - This formulation is **not standard in classical Boolean logic**, where implication is usually defined as:
        $A \to B = \neg A \lor B$
  - The formulation might require additional proof that it behaves identically to classical implication.

**Suggestion:** Explicitly prove that your implication definition satisfies truth tables for all cases.

---

### **4. Soundness and Completeness Proofs**
- The **structural induction proof** for completeness is valid but should be **explicitly proven** for all Boolean operations.
- The extension properties:
    $\lim_{\alpha \to 0} (\alpha A + (1-\alpha)B) = B$
  suggest interpolation but do not clarify whether interpolation is **logically meaningful**.
- **Type System Consistency:** The proof sketch ensures logical consistency, but does not guarantee closure under all GA operations (e.g., wedge products).

**Suggestion:** Consider adding an explicit **closure proof** under all defined operations.

---

### **5. Expressive Power and Future Work**
- The claim that **GLogic extends expressivity** is well-motivated but should be more explicitly tested:
  - Can GLogic express **higher-order logic** more effectively?
  - Does GLogic have a **computational advantage** over classical logic?

**Suggestion:** Provide an example where GLogic outperforms classical Boolean logic in terms of encoding power.
