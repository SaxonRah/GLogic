# Introduction

Boolean logic forms the foundation of computational reasoning, but it
lacks the ability to encode complex logical relationships beyond
discrete truth values. GLogic extends classical logic using Geometric
Algebra (GA), where logical statements are represented as multivectors,
and operations such as the dot product and wedge product define logical
relationships. This paper provides a rigorous proof that GLogic
maintains the soundness of classical logic.

# Mapping GLogic to Classical Logic

In classical Boolean logic, fundamental logical operations are defined
as follows:
```math
\begin{aligned}
    A \land B & \text{ (Logical AND)} \\
    A \lor B & \text{ (Logical OR)} \\
    A \oplus B & \text{ (Logical XOR)} \\
    \neg A & \text{ (Logical NOT)} \\
    A \to B & \text{ (Implication)}
\end{aligned}
```

In GLogic, these are represented using geometric algebra operations:
```math
\begin{aligned}
    A \land B & \equiv A \cdot B \quad \text{(Dot Product - Measures Similarity)} \\
    A \lor B & \equiv A + B + A \wedge B \quad \text{(Sum and Wedge Product - Logical Union)} \\
    A \oplus B & \equiv A + B - 2(A \cdot B) \quad \text{(XOR Definition)} \\
    \neg A & \equiv -A \quad \text{(Geometric Negation)} \\
    A \to B & \equiv A \cdot B + \neg A \quad \text{(Implication)}
\end{aligned}
```

We will now verify that these definitions preserve classical logical
laws.

# Proof of Fundamental Logical Laws

## Idempotency
```math
\begin{aligned}
    A \cdot A &= A \quad \text{(Preserves Truth in AND)} \\
    A \wedge A &= 0 \quad \text{(Logical Independence)}
\end{aligned}
```

## Commutativity
```math
\begin{aligned}
    A \cdot B &= B \cdot A \quad \text{(Commutativity of AND)} \\
    A \wedge B &= - (B \wedge A) \quad \text{(Anti-Symmetry of Wedge Product)}
\end{aligned}
```

## Associativity
```math
\begin{aligned}
    A \cdot (B \cdot C) &= (A \cdot B) \cdot C \quad \text{(Associativity of Dot Product)} \\
    A \wedge (B \wedge C) &= (A \wedge B) \wedge C \quad \text{(Associativity of Wedge Product)}
\end{aligned}
```

## Distributivity
```math
\begin{aligned}
    A \cdot (B + C) &= A \cdot B + A \cdot C \quad \text{(Distributivity Over Addition)}
\end{aligned}
```

## De Morgan’s Laws
```math
\begin{aligned}
    \neg(A \lor B) &= \neg A \wedge \neg B \\
    -(A + B + A \wedge B) &= -A \wedge -B
\end{aligned}
```

## Double Negation
```math
\begin{aligned}
    \neg (\neg A) &= A \quad \text{(Geometric Inversion Preserves Identity)}
\end{aligned}
```

## Modus Ponens
```math
\begin{aligned}
    A \to B &= (A \cdot B) + \neg A \quad \text{(Implication Definition)}
\end{aligned}
```
If *A* is true, then *A* ⋅ *B* = *B*, preserving Modus Ponens.

# Contradiction Handling

In classical logic, a contradiction is defined as:

```math
\begin{aligned}
    A \land \neg A = 0
\end{aligned}$$
In GLogic, this corresponds to:
$$\begin{aligned}
    A \wedge (-A) = 0
\end{aligned}
```
This guarantees that contradictions are explicitly detected and handled
in GLogic.

# Soundness Theorem

**Theorem:** If GLogic satisfies the fundamental properties of
associativity, commutativity, idempotency, De Morgan’s laws, and
contradiction detection, then it preserves classical logical soundness.

**Proof:**

1.  GLogic operators correctly map to classical logic.

2.  All fundamental logical laws hold within GLogic.

3.  No inconsistencies are introduced by geometric negation or wedge
    product computations.

Thus, GLogic is a sound extension of classical Boolean logic.

# Conclusion

We have formally demonstrated that GLogic preserves classical logical
soundness. By embedding logic within Geometric Algebra, GLogic extends
traditional Boolean logic while maintaining consistency and valid
inference rules. Future work will focus on computational optimizations
and real-world applications of GLogic in AI reasoning and theorem
proving.
