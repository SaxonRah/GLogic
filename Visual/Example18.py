checklist = """
When you see a Boolean formula, ask yourself:

☐ 1. "Where is this in 4D space?"
     Not "what's the output?" but "what's the position?"

☐ 2. "What's the bivector?"
     Always check correlation FIRST before anything else

☐ 3. "How far from other formulas?"
     Think in terms of geometric distance

☐ 4. "What operations can reach it?"
     Not "how to compute it" but "how to navigate to it"

☐ 5. "What's between this and that?"
     Embrace the continuous spectrum

☐ 6. "How does it transform?"
     See operations as movements, not calculations

☐ 7. "What's preserved under transformation?"
     Geometric properties are invariants

☐ 8. "Can I visualize the path?"
     Train your spatial intuition

When these become automatic, you're a geometric thinker! ✨

pitfalls = """
❌ PITFALL 1: "I need to evaluate to understand"
   ✅ FIX: Read the structure directly from components

❌ PITFALL 2: "Operations compute results"
   ✅ FIX: Operations are geometric transformations

❌ PITFALL 3: "Boolean has 16 operations, so does geometric"
   ✅ FIX: Boolean has 16 SAMPLES of infinite geometric space

❌ PITFALL 4: "Bivector is just extra information"
   ✅ FIX: Bivector IS the relationship; scalar is projection

❌ PITFALL 5: "Geometric product = Boolean AND"
   ✅ FIX: GP includes correlation; AND is its scalar shadow

❌ PITFALL 6: "This is just Boolean logic with extra steps"
   ✅ FIX: It's a fundamentally different computational model

❌ PITFALL 7: "I can ignore the geometry and just use formulas"
   ✅ FIX: The geometry IS the insight; formulas are notation

journey = """
Week 1: See formulas as POINTS
  • Draw them in 2D (truth, correlation) space
  • Estimate positions before computing
  • Build spatial intuition

Week 2: See operations as MOVEMENTS
  • Geometric product = combination
  • Reverse = reflection
  • Sandwich = rotation
  • Practice visualizing transformations

Week 3: See interpolation as PATHS
  • Connect any two formulas with smooth curves
  • Understand intermediate states
  • Embrace continuity

Week 4: Think in full 4D
  • All components matter
  • Bivector is primary, scalar is shadow
  • Distance and angle are fundamental

After 1 month: You're thinking geometrically! 🎉

The shift is complete when you can't UNSEE the geometry.
When someone says "P1 AND P2", you immediately visualize:
  • Position: (0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25)
  • Bottom-right quadrant
  • Positive correlation
  • Close to IFF, far from XOR
  • One rotation away from...

That's geometric thinking! 🚀
